Directory name specified in the source folder.

### Filter

The name of the directory to select or exclude. 

- wildcard : \"My*\"
- Specify a character for a specific location: \"fo?der\"

### Include/Exclude

The selection synchronizes the directory. Exclusion excludes directories from being synced. If the same directory as the selected directory is excluded, the exclusion takes precedence.
