### Change the execution order of sync tasks  
You can change the order by "holding down" the items (or pressing the "icon" on the left side of the screen) and moving them up or down.  
If it is selected, the order cannot be changed. Please change the order after deselecting all.  

### Remove sync task  
Tap the checkbox or task list name to select it, then tap the trash can icon at the bottom of the screen.  

### Add sync task
