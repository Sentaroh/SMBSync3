- Every month (executed at 10:30 on the 10th of every month)<br>
- Specify day of the week (executed at 21:00 on Monday and Friday)<br>
- Interval (Every 10 minutes, for example, every 10 minutes after the terminal is restarted)<br>

### Sync on the last day of every month<br>

If you check, you can run it on the last day of each month, such as the 31st for January, the 28th or 29th for February, and so on.<br>

### Reset interval schedule time<br>

Set the synchronization start time to the interval time. (If the interval time is set to 5 minutes and the save button is pressed at 1:10:20, the task starts at 1: 15: 0)<br>

When enabled, it will turn on Wi-Fi if it is off when syncing starts.<br>

- You can specify the amount of time to wait for synchronization to start after Wi-Fi is turned on.<br>
- Turn off back the Wifi once the scheduled tasks are completed.<br>
When enabled, it will turn off Wi-Fi at the end of synchronization.<br>

### Change the "Execute sync tasks only when charging" sync task option.<br>
